# Medical-Data-Visualizer

 Description:
Using a dataset of patient medical records, I cleaned and transformed the data to prepare it for visualization. I then created:

A categorical plot to explore distributions of cholesterol, glucose levels, smoking, alcohol use, etc.

A correlation heatmap to examine relationships between features like age, weight, blood pressure, and heart disease.

ðŸ›  Skills & Tools:

Data cleaning and normalization

Seabornâ€™s catplot() and heatmap()

Pandas for filtering, adding calculated columns, and formatting
